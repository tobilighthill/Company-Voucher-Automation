## ❓ TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I didn't receive the confirmation email"
**Solution**: Check your **Spam/Junk folder**. Search for "FormSubmit" or "noreply@formsubmit.co"

### "I didn't receive the voucher after confirming"
**Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes, then check spam again. If still nothing, ask the sender to resend.

### "The website doesn't load"
**Solution**: 
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different browser
- Clear your browser cache
- Contact IT support

### "I made a mistake on the voucher"
**Solution**: The system saves your vouchers in "Recent Vouchers" history. You can view them, but to make changes, create a new voucher.
