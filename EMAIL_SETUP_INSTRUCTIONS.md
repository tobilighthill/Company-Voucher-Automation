# Cash Voucher Email Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: One-Time Setup Required

The voucher system uses FormSubmit.co to send emails. This service requires a **one-time activation** for each new approver email address.

## How It Works

### First Time Sending to a New Email:
1. Fill out the voucher form
2. Enter the approver's email in the "Approved By (Email)" field
3. Click "Send for Approval"
4. A new tab will open showing "Success" or "Pending"

### What Happens Next:
- FormSubmit.co receives your voucher
- They send an **activation email** to the approver
- **The approver MUST check their inbox (and SPAM folder)**
- They will see an email from "FormSubmit" with subject "Confirm Your Email"
- **They MUST click the "Confirm" button** in that email

### After Activation:
- Once confirmed, ALL future vouchers will arrive instantly
- No more activation needed for that email address
- Emails will arrive within 1-2 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### "I clicked send but the approver didn't get anything"
- Check if the new tab showed "Success"
- Ask the approver to check their **SPAM/Junk folder**
- Look for an email from "FormSubmit" or "noreply@formsubmit.co"
- They need to click "Confirm Your Email" in that message

### "The approver confirmed but still no email"
- Wait 2-3 minutes (sometimes there's a delay)
- Check spam folder again
- Try sending another test voucher

### "I don't want to use FormSubmit"
**Alternative**: Use the "Download PDF" button instead, then email the PDF manually using your regular email (Outlook, Gmail, etc.)

## Current Email Flow

```
You Click "Send" 
    ↓
Form submits to: formsubmit.co/[approver-email]
    ↓
FormSubmit checks: "Is this email activated?"
    ↓
If NO → Sends activation email to approver (MUST CLICK)
If YES → Delivers voucher immediately
```

## Contact

If you continue to have issues, the approver's email provider might be blocking FormSubmit. In that case, use the PDF download feature instead.
