## 📧 What to Tell the Approver

**Copy and send this message:**

```
Hi [Approver Name],

I've sent you a cash voucher for approval. 

IMPORTANT: If this is your first time receiving a voucher from our system, you'll get TWO emails:

1. "Confirm Your Email" from FormSubmit - CLICK THE CONFIRM BUTTON
2. The actual voucher (arrives after you confirm)

Please check your SPAM/Junk folder if you don't see them in your inbox.

After this one-time confirmation, all future vouchers will arrive instantly!

Thanks!
```

## ✅ After Activation (Future Vouchers)

Once an email is activated:
- ✅ All future vouchers arrive in 1-2 minutes
- ✅ No more confirmation needed
- ✅ Goes straight to their inbox
- ✅ Professional table format
- ✅ 100% automatic

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "The approver didn't get the confirmation email"
**Solution**: Check SPAM/Junk folder. Search for "FormSubmit" or "noreply@formsubmit.co"

### "They clicked confirm but still no voucher"
**Solution**: Wait 2-3 minutes, then check spam again. If still nothing, send another test voucher.

### "The new tab shows an error"
**Solution**: This usually means the email format was wrong. Check for typos in the email address.

### "I want to test it myself first"
**Solution**: 
1. Enter YOUR OWN email in "Approved By"
2. Send a test voucher
3. Check your inbox/spam for the confirmation
4. Click confirm
5. You'll receive the voucher
6. Now you know exactly what the approver will experience!
